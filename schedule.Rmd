# Weekly schedule

LSR readings can be found in the free, online textbook, [_Learning Statistics with R_](https://learningstatisticswithr-bookdown.netlify.com/index.html) by Danielle Navarro. For those interested in taking notes, I recommend the use of the [Hypothes.is](http://Hypothes.is) app to annotate webpages. I will note that the formatting of the book online is wonky in a few places. If this bothers you, or you prefer to work offline, you can download a [PDF version](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/lsr-0.6.pdf) of the book.

# Overview

This course is the first in a two-course sequence that introduces necessary skills and knowledge for carrying out statistical analyses in the social sciences. The course has an applied focus for psychological research, but theoretical details will be emphasized when they facilitate understanding of key concepts. In other words, we will strike a balance between learning how to do statistics and knowing why we are doing it a particular way. Mastering both will facilitate generalization to new problems and techniques. Topics to be covered this semester include probability theory, measurement scales, theoretical sampling distributions (e.g., binomial, $t$, $F$, $\chi^2$), measures of central tendency and variability, inferences about population means, confidence intervals, the pros and cons of null hypothesis testing, power, and effect sizes, and ANOVA. 

### Textbook

We will primarily be referring to chapters in [_Learning Statistics with R_](https://learningstatisticswithr-bookdown.netlify.com/index.html) by Danielle Navarro. This textbook is available for free online. You may choose to purchase a paper copy if you wish, but it is not required. Additional readings assignments will be posted here. 

### R and RStudio

Students must have the latest version of R, which can be downloaded [here](https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/cran/). It is strongly recommended that students also download the RStudio GUI, available [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). Both are free. 

### Resources for R and RStudio

While we will be covering the use of R and RStudio extensively, one of the key skills required to use R is the ability to find answers on the Internet. The R community (sometimes referred to as the `useR` or `rstats` community) tends to be friendly and helpful and enjoys solving R-related problems in their spare time. For that reason, many common questions or problems have been posted to spaces online and answered by smart people. Finding and deciphering those answers is the key skill you should seek to hone this year. It's much more important than remembering function names. 

Here's a [resource page](data/resources2021.pdf) to get you going. 

# Graded materials

Your final grade is comprised of three components:

  - 6 Homework: 5\% each, 30\% total
  - 6 Peer Reviews: 2.5\% each, 15\% total
  - Exam 1: 15\%
  - Exams 2 & 3: 20\% each, 40\% total

### Homework assignments

Homework assignments are intended to gauge your ability to apply the topics covered in class to the practice of data analysis. Homework assignments are to be done using R and RMarkdown; completed assignments should be submitted to Canvas. Please submit BOTH your .Rmd and .html file. Please do not use PDF or Word documents. There will be 6 assignments in total, each worth 5% of your grade.

HWs are due at their due date by 9:30am. Grading will go by the following rubric:

  - 5/5: Completed all parts of the assignment, and results/interpretations were mostly correct (with maybe a few minor errors along the way)
  - 4/5: Completed all parts of the assignment, and ~25% of the results/interpretations are incorrect
  - 3/5: Completed all parts of the assignment, however ~50% of the results/interpretations are incorrect
  - 2/5: Either parts of the assignment are missing but what is there is correct, OR all parts have been completed but there are substantial issues with the results/interpretation
  - 1/5: Parts of the assignment are missing, and there are substantial issues with the results/interpretations
  - 0/5: No assignment submitted
  
You may work with your peers on homework assignments, with the following caveats:

1. Your code cannot be 100% identical to your peer's code (trust me, I can tell). It’s one thing to work together and consult, but it’s another thing to copy someone else’s assignment. If it is determined that someone copied an entire homework assignment, both parties will be given automatic zero.
2. If you work with someone, you *must* acknowledge them in the assignment itself. 

### Peer Reviews

It's important to get feedback on your work not just from the instructors/AIs but also from your peers. You will gain valuable experience in reading other peoples' code, which is far more prevalent than you might expect. Code reviews will take place on Canvas in Discussion threads. You will submit your code to the discussion thread by the assignment due date. You then have 72 hours (3 days) to complete the code review. You will follow the the template I provide for each code review. Each review will be worth 2.5% each for a total of 15% of your grade. 

### Exams

There will be 3 exams. As exams get closer, I will go over the procedures and policies with you before the exam. If you have a disability that will require additional time, please contact me and Disability Resources as soon as possible (contact information below). The first exam is worth 15% of your grade, and the remaining two exams are each worth 20% of your grade.

### Final Grading Rubric

All assignments and examinations are mandatory. If you need to miss an exam you must get in touch with me as soon as possible. Rescheduling of exams will be considered on a case by case basis, but I am _not_ required to approve a rescheduled exam.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}

& \text{> 100% = A+} \\
& \text{93% - 99.99% = A} \\
& \text{90% - 92.99% = A-} \\
& \text{87% - 89.99% = B+} \\
& \text{83% - 86.99% = B} \\
& \text{80% - 82.99% = B-} \\

\end{split}

\begin{split}
& \text{77% - 79.99% = C+} \\
& \text{73% - 76.99% = C} \\
& \text{70% - 72.99% = C-} \\
& \text{67% - 69.99% = D+} \\
& \text{63% - 66.99% = D} \\
& \text{60% - 62.99% = D-} \\
&\text{< 50% = F}

\end{split}
\end{equation}

# Learning from a Crappy Year 

The 2020-2021 academic year sucked. But instead of burying our heads in the sand and forgetting it existed, let's at least extract some things and incorporate them into our lives. For this class, here's what that means...

### Staying Connected

Last year was lonely. Although we're back in person, we still might feel that residual loneliness. On top of that, learning stats, learning to code, and grad school in general can be really scary -- impostor syndrome is real! The best thing we can do to combat these feelings is to stay connected to one another. Here's how we'll accomplish this in our class:

-	Your peer review will be with the same person. This way, you will get to know your buddy over the course of the semester. Make a friend! 

-	We will have a dedicated class Slack work space (see upper right corner of website for link). You can post questions that everyone can see, or make use of direct messaging. Shelly or the AIs will respond to your questions on Slack (if your peers don't respond first!). This is really great for one-off questions, or if you need some quick clarification on something. We will also have a dedicated channel for silly programming and stats memes, because humor is important when you're learning a skill like coding, in which you’ll repeatedly fail. Slack is not required *per se*, but it is **highly encouraged**.

### Be Considerate and Kind

- It is OK to not be OK. If you tell me you're having trouble, I'm not going to judge you or think less of you. I hope you will do the same for me. I will work with you to make sure we have a reasonable plan in place should something come up. *However*, this does require you telling me "hey, I'm not OK".
- You are always welcome to come talk to me about things that you're going through. If I can't help you, I usually know someone who can help -- or I can at least give you some resources and point you in the right direction.
- If you are struggling or need extra help, please just ask. I promise I will work with you.

### Attendance & In-person Etiquette

- **If you are not feeling well, don't come to class!!** I have recorded lectures from last year, you have access to the slides, and you can ask a friend for notes. You are adults. I am not going to take attendance. You do not need to tell me if you are missing class because you are sick. You only need to tell me if you are missing an exam or need extra time on a homework assignment etc. That said, if you miss 1-2 weeks of class without saying anything to me, I will reach out to you to see what's up.
- If there is even a *hint* of being sick, I prefer you stay home. If you are 100% sure it's nothing contagious -- like allergies, I still ask that you wear a mask and sit away from other students. 
- Most people will have electronics with them in class. Drinks should have a lid on them so that if they spill, we hopefully aren't ruining yours or another person's laptop/tablet/phone etc. Be careful!
- Occasionally, I'll ask you to get into small groups and chat about something. Be aware that other people might not be super comfortable being physically close together. Maintain appropriate distance, and if a classmate asks you to step back a bit, please do so. 

### Online Etiquette

There will be a lot of online communication with the instructor, the AI, and your peers. You are expected to maintain a polite and respectful tone in their online discourse. Some things to consider:

  -	Any communication shared privately may become public, so be mindful of what you share in discussion boards or chats. This is especially true for sharing any personal and/or identifying information about you or someone else. Do not share any passwords or divulge any personal information (yours or others) that can be used in a malicious manner (phone numbers, addresses etc.).
  -	Humor doesn't always translate in an online forum. If you want to make a joke or a sarcastic remark, be 100% sure that it is clear you are joking. 
  -	Your comments must be readable to everyone. Very common acronyms are OK (“lol” or “haha”). But please refrain from acronyms that are not as well-known (“fwiw” etc.).
  -	Treat your classmates, professor, and AIs with kindness and respect. Any indication of online harassment or bullying will not be tolerated and will be reported. This is especially pertinent when giving constructive feedback in code reviews.
  - Please avoid using ALL CAPS because it can be interpreted as yelling.

# Policies & Resources
