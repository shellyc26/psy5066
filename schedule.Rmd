# Weekly schedule

LSR readings can be found in the free, online textbook, [_Learning Statistics with R_](https://learningstatisticswithr-bookdown.netlify.com/index.html) by Danielle Navarro. For those interested in taking notes, I recommend the use of the [Hypothes.is](http://Hypothes.is) app to annotate webpages. I will note that the formatting of the book online is wonky in a few places. If this bothers you, or you prefer to work offline, you can download a [PDF version](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/lsr-0.6.pdf) of the book.

# Graded materials

Your final grade is comprised of three components:

  - 6 (almost biweekly) Quizzes: 5\% each, 30\% total 
  - 6 (almost biweekly) Homework: 5\% each, 30\% total
  - Exam 1: 10\%
  - Exam 2: 15\%
  - Exam 3: 15\%


## Quizzes

Quizzes are intended to assess your understanding of the theoretical principles underlying statistics. They will be administered via Canvas. The Canvas quizzes will be posted at noon on Thursdays, and will be due by **9am on Tuesday**. For example, the first quiz will be posted on Thursday 9/17 at 12pm and will be due 9/22 at 9am. There will be a quiz due every other Tuesday (there are some exceptions – please see the schedule). You may take this quiz as many times as you’d like before the due date/time. I will accept your most *recent* submission. You may not retake the quiz after the due date has passed. You can use resources such as lecture slides, notes, and the textbook for these quizzes. The only resource you *cannot* use are your peers! 

## Homework assignments

Homework assignments will be posted one week before they are due. All assignments will make use of R statistical software. In addition, homework assignments will ask students to critically describe their findings in a write-up, with consideration of the potential flaws of the statistical and methodological strategy. Homework assignments will not be accepted after the deadline, and they should be turned in on Canvas. You may work with your peers on homework assignments, with the following caveats:

1. Your code cannot be 100% identical to your peer's code (trust me, I can tell). It’s one thing to work together and consult, but it’s another thing to copy someone else’s assignment. If it is determined that someone copied an entire homework assignment, both parties will be given automatic zero.
2. If you work with someone, you *must* acknowledge them in the assignment itself. 

Homework assignments may be resubmitted with corrections and receive full credit. Please note, however, that corrections can only be made to problems for which an answer was attempted at initial submission. You may only resubmit a homework **once**. If you would like to resubmit a homework, your resubmission must be within sent to the AI within 3 days of receiving the graded assignment. For example, if a homework assignment was returned to you on Thursday 8/27, your resubmission must be sent to the AI by the end of the day Sunday 8/30.

## Exams

There will be 3 exams that will be administered online. As of this iteration of the syllabus, these will be timed exams. This is subject to change, however I will provide you with written communication to any changes made. As exams get closer, I will go over the procedures and policies with you before the exam. If you have a disability that will require additional time, please contact me and Disability Resources as soon as possible (contact information below). 

All assignments and examinations are mandatory. If you are to miss an exam you must get in touch with me as soon as possible. Rescheduling of exams will be considered on a case by case basis, but the instructor is not required to approve a rescheduled exam.

# Materials needed

We will be using R for all data wrangling, visulaization, and analysis. You may not use another statistical program in this course.
Students must have the latest version of R, which can be downloaded [here](https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/cran/). It is strongly recommended that students also download the RStudio GUI, available [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). Both softwares are free. 

All reading assignments will be posted online. 

# Policies & Resources

**University Code of Conduct:**

- Any student found guilty of academic misconduct, such as cheating, plagiarizing, forgery, or furnishing false information to a University official will be subject to consequences including failing the class, suspension from the University, or expulsion from the University. Frankly, you're in graduate school, and the purpose of work is to create opportunities to learn and improve. Even if cheating helps you in the short term, you'll quickly find yourself ill-prepared for the career you have chosen. If you find yourself tempted to cheat, please come speak to me about an extension and developing tools to improve your success.

Washington University faculty and administrators strive to maintain confidentiality, but some information may need to be disclosed when it is a matter of safety._

# COVID-19 & How to be OK

*(This section was created and slightly modified from [this awesome tweet by Dr. Chris Jones](https://twitter.com/ProfChrisMJones/status/1282036533562834944). And, you know, the state of the world)*

In case you hadn’t noticed, there is a **_global pandemic_**. None of us are really “OK”. If you tell me you’re having trouble, I’m not going to judge you or think less of you. I hope you’ll extend me the same grace. 

Let’s set the stage:

  -	You never owe me personal information about your health (mental or physical), or anything else. Since this course is entirely online, we do not have to worry about the whole class physically distancing or needing to go into quarantine if one of us is exposed.
  -	You are always welcome to come talk to me about things that you’re going through, however.
  -	If I can’t help you, I usually know somebody who can.
  -	If you need extra help or you need more time with something, just ask. I’ll work with you. Promise. 

# Online Learning

For those of you who have never taken an online class (and those who have!), one thing you might not be prepared for is the amount of *intrinsic motivation* needed to succeed. While it’s great to be able to access material at your own pace, many students mistakenly think this somehow makes the class easier. It is, unfortunately, all too common for students to fall into the trap of procrastination and ultimately fall behind in the class. Don’t let this be you! Here are some steps you can take right now to ensure you are ready to rock and roll:

  - Make a schedule for yourself, and stick to it! Carve out time to watch the lectures and complete the homeworks & quizzes. Time management is the key to online success and graduate school more generally. There are TONS of apps and tools to help you with this and can take the form of calendars, organizers, time tracking apps etc.
  - If you get distracted by all the other websites on the planet, consider some apps like [Cold Turkey](https://getcoldturkey.com/), [Freedom](https://freedom.to/stayfocusd), or others that will block external sites (Twitter, Netflix etc.) and help you focus.
