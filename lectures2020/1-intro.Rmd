## Kinds of statistics

- Descriptive
- Inferential

???
Which is more important? -- Neither

Descriptive -- about the data
Inferential -- about the world
- assessing risk or uncertainty. How likely?

---

## Kinds of statistics

- Exploratory
- Confirmatory

--




.center[Exploratory ---------------------------------------- Confirmatory]

???
Which is more important? -- Neither

Exploratory -- I don't have a hypothesis or theory. I don't know what's going to happen
Confirmatory -- if theory X is true, then data should look like Y

Really more of a continuum

## Kinds of research

- Experimental
- Observational

--

Typically we pair some kinds of statistical tests with experimental work and other kinds of tests with observational work.

--

In reality, most statistical tests can be used with most kinds of research. It's not so much the kind of research that matters, but __which statistic helps to answer your question__ and __what types of variables do you have?__

- We'll discuss the first point throughout the course
- Let's discuss variables now

---

## Scales of measurement

Four scales
- Nominal
- Ordinal
- Interval 
- Ratio

---

## Nominal

- response options are groups
- no specific order
- example: What is your favorite fruit? Blueberries, apples, coconuts


---

## Ordinal

- response options are ordered
- no consistent distance between possible scores
- example: List the following fruits in order of preference: peaches, grapes, raspberries

---

## Interval

- response options are ordered
- distance between response options is the same
- no meaningful 0 
- example: On a scale from 0-5, how much do you like bananas?


---

## Ratio

- response options are ordered
- distance between response options is the same
- 0 indicates an _absence_ of something
- example: how many times have you eaten watermelon in the last 6 months?


---

## Scales of measurement

.pull-left[
- Nominal
- Ordinal
- Interval 
- Ratio
]

--


.pull-right[
- **Why does this matter?**

  - Different amounts of information
  - Different mathematical properties
      - Example: Bobby scores 6 and Megan scores 3. If the scale is interval, can we say Bobby scored twice as high as Megan?]

---

## Scales of measurement

.pull-left[
- Nominal
- Ordinal
- Interval 
- Ratio]

.pull-right[
**You try!**

- "On a scale from 1 to 6, how much does the word *outgoing* describe you?"]

---

## Scales of measurement

Two types
- Categorical
- Continuous

---

## Scales of measurement

.pull-left[
- Nominal
- Ordinal
- Interval 
- Ratio
]

.pull-right[
- Categorical
- Continuous
]

How do these two methods of describing scales match up?

--

  - Nominal & ordinal variables will always be categorical

--

  - Interval and ratio variables will *usually* be continuous, but they can sometimes be discrete, too.

--

  - Height
    - inches/cm ---> RATIO
    - what shelf can you reach in the pantry? ---> INTERVAL
    - rank from tallest to shortest ---> ORDINAL
