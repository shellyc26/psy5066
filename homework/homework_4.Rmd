# Instructions

This assignment is going to be a little different than what we've done. Here's what's going to happen:

-   First, watch this video on using RMarkdown and customization. It is truly an EXCELLENT talk.

-   You will create your own RMarkdown file, and you need to utilize at least 5 things from the video. It can range from themes, to inserting tables or equations, formatting the text to be bold/italics, bibliographies, formatting figures on the page. You can choose. But the resulting output document needs to look amazing.

-   In this gorgeous RMarkdown document that you create, you will answer the questions below. So the content will be the questions/answers, and the formatting better be ðŸ”¥

- Please turn in both documents to the **ASSIGNMENTS** page *and* the **PEER REVIEW DISCUSSION** on Canvas.

Good luck!
