```{r setup, include=FALSE}
set.seed(15)
trickRtreat <- data.frame("Candy"=cbind(c(round(rnorm(n=500, mean=13.256, sd = 1.243)), round(rnorm(n=35, mean=14.5742, sd = 4.4523)))), "Age"=c(rep("Kid", 500), rep("Adult", 35)))
# simulated data. How much Candy did each individual get? And are they adults or kids?
psych::describeBy(trickRtreat$Candy, group = trickRtreat$Age)
```

Then run the test
```{r}
library(broom)
results <- t.test(Candy ~ Age, data = trickRtreat)
results_pretty <- tidy(results)
```

Now, there is a significant difference `r results_pretty$p.value`
