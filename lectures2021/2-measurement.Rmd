## Why statistics

- An essential aid to “signal detection”

- A universal language for communicating what we find.

- Required for competent evaluation of others’ work.

## Goal of today

Advanced skill in quantitative methods carries with it the responsibility to use those skills carefully and ethically.

Today, we'll discuss methodological issues present in statistics. 
- It can be tempting to use statistics to fix poor research design.
- These issues cannot be fixed quantitatively (even when it looks like they can).

- After today, we focus on what happens after you collect data. But it is still your job to study research design, data collection, and theoretical logic.

## Constructs

- Our basic goal in science is to make inferences about the causal relations between constructs.

## Measuring the Invisible 

We can’t do that directly, so we rely on proxies for those constructs.
![](images/intro_operation.jpg)

In order to infer that A --> B, we have to make three assumptions:
 - X is a good proxy for A
 - Y is a good proxy for B
 - X and Y are causally related
 
---

## Measuring the Invisible

- When the first two assumptions are true, the relation between X and Y will provide a good estimate of the relation between A and B.

- What threatens our ability to carry out this seemingly simple task? 
    - How do quantitative methods help us solve these problems?

---

## Validity

Four kinds of validity in research threaten our ability to make valid causal inferences. Solving each problem either directly requires quantitative methods or makes use of principles that are central to quantitative methods.


- Statistical conclusion validity

- Internal validity

- Construct validity

- External validity

---

## Statistical conclusion validity

- **Definition:** the validity of the inference that X and Y are related

![](images/intro_operation.jpg)

- most basic: correlation coefficient (
$r_{xy}$
)
    - even more advanced methods index covariation in some way

## Internal validity

- **Definition:** the validity of the inference that X and Y are causally related.

  - Given that X and Y are correlated, can we validly infer that the relation is causal?

--

- Traditional view: direction, correlation, confounds

--

- Counter-factual view
   - Effect is what did happen compared to what would have happened to the same people had they not had the treatment at the same time.
   - Major research design tools: manipulation, control, random assignment, replication, logic, common sense.

    
???

direction = Cause precedes effect

correlation = Cause covaries with effect

confounds = Other explanations are ruled less plausible

### Threats to internal validity

.pull-right[

Temporal precedence can be established in an experiment because treatment precedes outcome. 

But, when treatment is not possible, then logic and common sense can sometimes dictate temporal precedence.

.small[History refers to any event that occurs between the beginning of treatment and the measurement of outcome that might have produced the observed effect.

- A marketing campaign intended to increase beer sales happens to coincide with other events that might have the same effect: a particularly hot period of weather, a long losing streak by the St. Louis Cardinals, etc.]

Maturation refers to changes in the organism that occur regardless of treatment and that may masquerade as a treatment effect.

- A school-wide educational intervention is predicted to increase achievement test scores.  The entire school must get the same curriculum, so a control group in the school is not possible.

Testing refers to the possible change that may occur just because participants have been previously measured. These are often called practice or fatigue effects.

- Students do better on the first half of test compared to the second.
- Students do better in the second half of the term compared to the first.

.pull-right[

Change may occur because the measurement changes over time, perhaps becoming more or less reliable. 

Instrumentation reflects changes in the measurement; testing reflects changes in the object of measurement.

class: middle

The key point with internal validity is that something else besides the treatment is a plausible alternative explanation for any apparent treatment effect. 

Solving threats to internal validity is a research design problem, not a statistics problem.  Nonetheless, quantitative methods play a key role in making the case for internal validity.

### Removing the influence of other variables

If the "other variables" can be measured, their influence can be statistically controlled so that the hypothesized relation can be detected more accurately.

However:

**Statistical control should best be thought of as a method of last resort, to be used when design controls are not available or have failed.**


---

## Construct validity

![](images/cronbach.png)
???

##Apologize for section of article that suggests a link between "homosexual signs" and pathology -- that's just gross

##Questions: 

**1. What is construct validity?** -- Does this variable measure what it says it's going to measure?

**2. How do we determine construct validity?** -- Show that the variable correlates with all of the things it should correlate with and none of the things it shouldn't

**3. How do we figure out what it should correlate with?** -- Nomological net(work); theory
---

## Construct validity

- The validity of the inference that a given operationalization of of a construct does a good job representing the construct. 

![](images/intro_operation.jpg)

---

class: middle

- Construct validity refers to the correctness of the label that is applied to the operation. It depends on first demonstrating adequate reliability and then is bolstered by demonstrating relations of the target operation to other operations.

### Threats to construct validity

- **inadequate explication of constructs**

- **construct confounding**

- confounding constructs with levels of constructs

- reactive self-report changes

- reactivity to the experimental situation

- experimenter expectancy

- novelty and disruption effects

---
### Construct confounding

.pull-left[Operations usually tap more than one construct. Failure to recognize the full set of constructs embedded in the operation can lead to incorrect inferences about the constructs that are active.

A self-report of optimism might also reflect self-esteem or positive affect.  How can quantitative methods help?

## External validity 

- **Definition:** The validity of the inference that a causal relation between operations *generalizes* to other units, treatments, observations, or settings.

What if I told all my research participants that my job depended on the outcome of the study they are in? The participants might change their behaviors. And their behavior is what we are studying. So anything I find might not be generalizable (even if unintentional). Need to remain neutral!

### Threats to external validity

.pull-left[
- sampling bias

- experimenter effects

- **Hawthorne effect**

- testing effects

- situation effects
]

.pull-right[
The Hawthorne Effect says that the fact that people know they are being observed might be enough to change their behavior.

Ex: if someone is in a study about stress, and they know they are in the study (informed consent), maybe they make themselves seem more stressed than they actually are. They might fill out surveys with scores reflecting higher levels of stress than what they might fill out if they didn't think they were being watched.

- Hawthorne effect

- **testing effects**

- situation effects
]

.pull-right[
Testing effects are especially critical in pre/post designs. At the pre-test, they are nervous. But at the post-test, they know what to expect and are less anxious etc. Really problematic when studying something like, say, anxiety.

.pull-left[

]

.pull-right[
Situation effects can be things like time of day, the setting of the experiment/location etc. 

What if you study recall memory. You have all your participants come in before 10am. You find an effect. 

Now you repeat the study, but you have all your participants come in after 8pm. You don't find an effect.

## Your Ethical Duty as a Scientist

Advanced skill in quantitative methods carries with it the responsibility to use those skills **carefully and ethically**.

- Know the shortcomings of your study
- REPORT the shortcomings of your study
- Let your readers understand the limitations
- Do NOT overstate your findings (or let the press overstate them)
