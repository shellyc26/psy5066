## Review 1

The holidays are upon us! You want to know if happiness (scale of 1-10) this time of year is impacted by which holiday folks celebrate (Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanza) and ugly sweaters (ugly, not ugly). You're specifically interested in whether these interact. That is, you think that an ugly Christmas sweater might bring more joy than an ugly Hanukkah sweater or ugly Kwanza sweater. Here are the data:

|               | Ugly Sweater | Not Ugly Sweater |
|---------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Christmas** | 7, 6, 9, 8   | 4, 5, 3, 5       |
| **Hanukkah**  | 4, 8, 10, 7  | 4, 3, 4, 4       |
| **Kwanza**    | 8, 6, 5, 5   | 2, 3, 2, 5       |

Calculate the ANOVA for main effects and interaction. Be able to interpret all *F* tests.
