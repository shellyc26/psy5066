# Question Set 1

Let's MANUALLY calculate the correlation between two variables X and Y

```{r, echo=FALSE}
X<-c(6,12,13,17,22,25,27,29,30,32)
Y<-c(45,47,39,58,68,76,75,74,78,81)

cbind(X,Y)
```

# Question Set 2

- Scientists have discovered that 14% of Adelie penguins have a genetic condition that prevents them from being able to reproduce. If 40 Adelie penguins are selected at random from any of the 3 islands, how many penguins could be expected to be able to reproduce?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
table(penguins$species, penguins$island)
```

# Question Set 3

- For an upcoming stats exam we have decided to be lazy and only make 5 multiple choice questions. The questions have 4 response options each. How likely are students to get *at least 4* of these questions correct simply by guessing? Calculate this "by hand" meaning do not use a `R` function

---

# Question Set 4

- Get the z-scores of the `body_mass_g` variable "by hand" meaning do not use a `R` function
- Which value is furthest away from the mean? Which is closest?
- Interpret the 10th z-score
- Which of these is an outlier? How do you propose to deal with this outlier?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tinyp = penguins[c(1:3, 5:11),3:6]
tinyp
```

---

# Question Set 5

- Which of these variables are qualitative? Quantitative?
- Which variable would be appropriate for a binomial question?
- Which variable do you assume is normally distributed? $t$ distributed?
- Calculate the standard error of the mean for `bill_depth_mm` and describe what it means
