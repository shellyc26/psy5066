## Review 1

The holidays are upon us! You want to know if happiness (scale of 1-10) this time of year is impacted by which holiday folks celebrate (Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa) and ugly sweaters (ugly, not ugly). You're specifically interested in whether these interact. That is, you think that an ugly Christmas sweater might bring more joy than an ugly Hanukkah sweater or ugly Kwanzaa sweater. Here are the data:

|               | Ugly Sweater | Not Ugly Sweater |
|---------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Christmas** | 7, 6, 9, 8   | 4, 5, 3, 5       |
| **Hanukkah**  | 4, 8, 10, 7  | 4, 3, 4, 4       |
| **Kwanzaa**   | 8, 6, 5, 5   | 2, 3, 2, 5       |

Calculate the ANOVA for main effects and interaction. Be able to interpret all *F* tests. Do this using a model comparison approach.

## Create DataFrame

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

holidays <- data.frame(
  Happiness = c(7, 6, 9, 8, 4, 5, 3, 5, 4, 8, 10, 7,
                4, 3, 4, 4, 8, 6, 5, 5, 2, 3, 2, 5),
  Holiday = rep(c("Christmas", "Hanukkah", "Kwanzaa"), each = 8),
  Sweater = rep(c(rep("Ugly", 4), rep("Not Ugly", 4)), 3)
) %>%
  mutate(
    Holiday = as.factor(Holiday),
    Sweater = as.factor(Sweater)
  )

holidays <- holidays %>%
  select(Holiday, Sweater, Happiness)
```

---

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
holidays %>% group_by(Holiday) %>%
  slice_head(n = 3) %>%
  kable("html") %>% 
  kable_styling(font_size = 16)
```

---

## Determine Degrees of Freedom

```{r}
# three cells for holiday: christmas, hanukkah, kwanzaa
df_holiday <- 3 - 1
df_sweater <- 2 - 1
df_interaction <- (3-1) * (2-1)

#holiday has 3 levels, sweater has 2 levels 
df_w <- 24 - (3 * 2)

c(df_holiday, df_sweater, df_interaction, df_w)
```

---

## Fill out DF Column:

<img src="images/df.png", width="75%">

## Sum of Squares for Holiday (Restricted Model)

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
grandMean <- mean(holidays$Happiness)

#making a function to calc error
calculate_error <- function(data, predictions) {
  errors <- data$Happiness - predictions
  sum(errors^2)
}

#also known as the error of the restricted model
ss_restricted <- calculate_error(holidays, rep(grandMean, nrow(holidays)))
ss_restricted
```

---

## Sum of Squares for Holiday (Full Model)

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
holiday_means <- holidays %>%
  group_by(Holiday) %>%
  summarize(mean_happiness = mean(Happiness), .groups = "drop")

predictions_holiday <- holidays %>%
  left_join(holiday_means, by = "Holiday") %>%
  pull(mean_happiness)

#also known as the error of the full model
ss_full_holiday <- calculate_error(holidays, predictions_holiday)
ss_full_holiday
```

---

## Sum of Squares Holiday is... 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
SSHoliday <- ss_restricted - ss_full_holiday
dfh <- nlevels(holidays$Holiday) - 1
MSHoliday <- SSHoliday / dfh
SSHoliday
```

---

## SS Sweater

```{r}
sweater_means <- holidays %>%
  group_by(Sweater) %>%
  summarize(mean_happiness = mean(Happiness), .groups = "drop")

predictions_sweater <- holidays %>%
  left_join(sweater_means, by = "Sweater") %>%
  pull(mean_happiness)

#calcing the error of the full model for sweater
ss_full_sweater <- calculate_error(holidays, predictions_sweater)
SSSweater <- ss_restricted - ss_full_sweater
SSSweater
```

---

## SS Interaction

The goal is to create a table like this, and calculate the SS Interaction: 

|                  | Ugly Sweater | Not Ugly Sweater | Row Means |
|------------------|--------------|------------------|-----------|
| **Christmas**    | 7, 6, 9, 8   | 4, 5, 3, 5       | **5.875** |
| **Hanukkah**     | 4, 8, 10, 7  | 4, 3, 4, 4       | **5.5**   |
| **Kwanzaa**      | 8, 6, 5, 5   | 2, 3, 2, 5       | **4.5**   |
| **Column Means** | **6.92**     | **3.67**         | **5.29**  |

---

## SS Interaction

```{r, message=FALSE}
means = holidays %>% 
  group_by(Holiday, Sweater) %>% 
  summarize(m = mean(Happiness))

means
```

---

## SS Interaction

```{r echo = FALSE}
#cell means
interaction_means <- holidays %>%
  group_by(Holiday, Sweater) %>%
  summarize(mean_happiness = mean(Happiness), .groups = "drop")

#row and column means
row_means <- holidays %>%
  group_by(Holiday) %>%
  summarize(row_mean = mean(Happiness), .groups = "drop")

col_means <- holidays %>%
  group_by(Sweater) %>%
  summarize(col_mean = mean(Happiness), .groups = "drop")

#table time
interaction_table <- interaction_means %>%
  left_join(row_means, by = "Holiday") %>%
  left_join(col_means, by = "Sweater") %>%
  mutate(
    interaction_effect = mean_happiness - row_mean - col_mean + grandMean
  )
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
interaction_table  %>% 
  kable("html") %>% 
  kable_styling(font_size = 16)
```
```{r}
#calcing SSInteraction
SSInteraction <- sum((interaction_table$interaction_effect)^2) * 4
SSInteraction
```

---

## SS Within

```{r}
predictions_within <- holidays %>%
  left_join(interaction_means, by = c("Holiday", "Sweater")) %>%
  pull(mean_happiness)

SSWithin <- calculate_error(holidays, predictions_within)
SSWithin
```

## Review 3

## Review 4

#### What tests did we learn about? 

- Compare sample mean to population mean with unknown sigma

- Compare 2 means with within-groups design

- Compare 2 means with between-groups design

- Compare 3+ levels of IV

- 2+ IVs (main effects/interactions)
