# Miscellaneous

## Last time

- 2x2 ANOVA with interactions
- NHST and effect sizes

--

## Today

A series of shpiels 

- Finish up between-subjects ANOVA
- Within-subjects designs
- Non-parametric tests

---

## OG data

![](images/ogdata.png)

---

## What we did...

- Found the means for each cell in our 2x2 ANOVA

- Took away the effect of each of the 2 factors (Age and Problem)

- Added back the grand mean

---

## Another way of doing the interaction


`\(H_{0.3}\)` : *The differences between age groups are the same regardless of problem type (tricky or normal)*

![](images/ixcontrast1.png)

---

## Null hypothesis for interactions

`\(H_{0.3}\)` : *The differences between age groups are the same regardless of problem type (tricky or normal)*

`\(H_{0.3} : (\mu_{N8} - \mu_{N9}) = (\mu_{T8} - \mu_{T9})\)`

`\(H_{0.3} : (\mu_{N8} - \mu_{N9}) - (\mu_{T8} - \mu_{T9}) = 0\)`

`\(H_{0.3} : \mu_{N8} - \mu_{N9} - \mu_{T8} + \mu_{T9} = 0\)`

 **First rule of contrasts is that they must sum to 0**
---

## Coontrasts are your friends!

`$$F = \frac{\psi^2}{MS_\text{Within}\Sigma(c_j^2/n_j)}$$`

$$ \psi = (1)(3.50) + (-1)(3.75) + (-1)(0.25) + (1)(2.00)  = 1.50 $$
`$$F = \frac{1.50^2}{.375\Sigma(c_j^2/n_j)}$$`
`$$F = \frac{1.50^2}{.375(\frac{1^2}{4} + \frac{-1^2}{4} + \frac{-1^2}{4} + \frac{1^2}{4})}$$`

`$$F = \frac{2.25}{.375} = 6$$`
---

## Did we get it right?

## Testing Ourselves

New 2x2 design comparing treatments to reduce depression

  * Therapy = Cognitive Behavioral vs. Meditation Training
  * Medication = With meds vs. Without meds

## Assumptions of ANOVA

1. Experimental errors are normally distributed (more later)

2. Equal variances between treatments. Aka homogeneity of variances.

3. Independence of samples (more next)

--

What happens when we break some of these assumptions?

---
class: inverse, center, middle

# Within-subjects

---

## What is it?

- Other names: within-groups, repeated measures

- Each subject contributes a score to each level of an independent variable (breaking independence assumption)

- We've done this before...paired `\(t\)`-test

  - Pre vs. Post 
  
---

## Why does this matter?

- Some of the variability in the scores within a level of a factor is predictable if you know which participant contributed the score.

- If you could remove the variability that goes with the differences between the participants, you could reduce the variability within a level of the factor. 
  
  - Same participants, or paired in some way (matched)
  
---

## Repeated Measures ANOVA 

- You can calculate, and then discard, the variability among the means that comes from differences between the subjects

  - What does this mean if you want to know about individual differences?
  
--

- The remaining variability in the dataset is then partitioned into 2 components:

  1. variance due to differences between treatments/conditions/levels
  2. variance due to error (like measurement error, random noise etc.)

---

## What changes in the calculations? 

- Restricted Model: `\(\Sigma D_i^2\)`

  - The null is that there is no difference in the participants' scores between conditions
  - Take the difference scores, square them, sum them up
  - `\(df_r\)` = how many difference scores there are; you do not remove a df because you don't use a mean
  
---
## What changes in the calculations? 

- Full Model: `\(\Sigma(D_i - \bar{D})^2\)`

  - The full model/alternative hypothesis is that there is a difference in the participants' scores between conditions
  - Take each individual's difference score and find the deviation for that difference score from the mean difference score of the sample. Square it, sum it up. 
  - EX: pre = 8, post = 10, diff = 2
  - EX: if the average of the difference scores was 5, you would then do `2 - 5 = -3`
  - `\(df_f\)` = number of difference scores - 1; you lose 1 df because you calculated the mean of difference scores
  
---

## The Consequences -- Good

- Same participants = less time and effort

- Statistical POWER!
  - What goes into our F-statistic? `\(\frac{MS_{btwn}}{MS_{error}}\)` 
  - The smaller `\(MS_{error}\)`, the larger the `\(F\)`-statistic
  - The repeated design allows you to remove the between-subject variability, so `\(MS_{error}\)` gets smaller
  
---

## The Consequences -- Bad

- Often not feasible

- Order effects

  - Everyone gets Chocolate -&gt; Vanilla -&gt; Strawberry
  - How do you know that eating chocolate ice cream first doesn't change the way vanilla tastes to participants? 
  - You need to counterbalance! (some get c -&gt; v -&gt; s, some get v -&gt; s -&gt; c etc...)
  
- Time elapsed can be...tricky

  - Take Josh Jackson's Applied Longitudinal class
  - Take Mike Strube's Hierarchical Linear Modeling class
---

## Shelly hates within-subjects ANOVAs

- When you have a within-subjects variable, our homogeneity assumption expands out to "sphericity"
- Rather than the groups having the same variances, now it's the DIFFERENCE SCORES WITHIN THE GROUP that have to have the same variances
- **At best you get the same answer as you would with a multilevel model**
- At worst, you've violated assumptions (rather aggressively) and therefore it's not valid to interpret the results
- More important: if you have within-subject variance, just explicitly model it!

# Analysis of Covariance (conceptually)

---

## Logic of ANCOVA

Say you want to do an ANOVA, but there's an additional variable (continuous or categorical) whose influence you wish to *control for*. We call that a **covariate**. 

Ex:

- Effect of treatment, controlling for initial levels of some disorder

- Controlling for known effects like age, sex, SES, etc...

---

## Logic of ANCOVA

We just need to add another term to our restricted and full models.

Restricted: 

`$$Y_{ij} = \mu + Covariate + e_{ij}$$`
Full: 
`$$Y_{ij} = \mu + Age_{j} + Covariate + e_{ij}$$`

---

## ANCOVA Thoughts

The Good:

- Can increase power by reducing `\(SS_{within}\)`
- Some use to control for initial levels of a disorder (meh)

--

The Bad:

- We will talk about regression extensively next semester; IMHO, use formal regression framework instead
- You're losing a degree of freedom in both your full and restricted models. So if you include a covariate that doesn't matter much, and now you've lost a df, then you might inadvertently wind up with less statistical power. Oy!

# Non-parametric Tests

---

## Normality Assumption

- For `\(t\)`-test, we said the data needed to be normally distributed
  - can use QQ plots (quantile-quantile plots)
  - can use Shapiro-Wilk test
  
--

- For ANOVA, it's slightly different...
  - `\(H_0 : Y_{ij} = \mu + \epsilon_{ij}\)`
  - `\(H_1 : Y_{ij} = \mu_j + \epsilon_{ij}\)`
  - The assumption is that `\(\epsilon_{ij}\)`, or your residuals, need to be normally distributed -- lots more next semester
  - Can use QQ plots and Shaprio-Wilk -- QQ plots more common
  
---

## QQ Plots

Try this (you might be limited to # of times you can click):

Check out [this Stack Exchange](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/101274/how-to-interpret-a-qq-plot) on how to interpret QQ plots.

---

## Who cares?

If we violate our assumptions, *any of them*, we cannot make any valid inferences! 

![](23-within_files/figure-html/cat.png)

---
## Non-parametric tests

Enter non-parametric tests. Often these are based on using the rank order of data (and the median instead of the mean).

Helpful when:

  - Dependent variable is nominal
  - Independent or dependent variable is ordinal
  - Sample size is small
  - Underlying population is skewed (reaction times, household income)

---

## Non-parametric tests

Limitations:

  - CI and effect size calculations aren't always possible (or if they are, they're a pain)
  - Less powerful typically
  - Increased risk of a Type II error; maybe that's OK?
  - Nominal/ordinal scales provide less detail than continuous data
