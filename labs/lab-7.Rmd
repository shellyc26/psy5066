# Purpose

The purpose of today's lab is to walk through how to create a pre-registration on the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io){target="_blank"}. Rather than serve as a step-by-step tutorial, this page will mostly contain links to other resources on pre-registration and open science that you can use when drafting your own preregistrations, along with a few questions/prompts to guide our discussion. 

*Note:* A lot of the material in this document has been copied (or adapted) from pregistration workshops by Moin Syed (https://osf.io/pm8bh/) and Cassie Brandes (https://osf.io/pm8bh/).

## 1. What do I need to do when writing up my preregistered study?

* Include a link to your preregistration
* Report results of *all* pre-registered analyses
* Any unregistered analyses must be transparent 

See [here](https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/zwkqj/?action=download%26mode=render){target="_blank"} and [here](https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/3k7hf/?action=download%26mode=render){target="_blank"} for more resources from the Center for Open Science on what to include when reporting the results of preregistered research.



## 2. What if I need to change my research plan? 

* If you decide to make changes to your analysis plan *after* looking at your data/results, be sure to still report what you said what you were originally going to do, and you can still report your unplanned analyses, but you must indicate that these were unplanned. 

* If you decide to make changes *before* seeing your data, you can withdraw your original preregistration and create a new plan.

## 3. Can't someone "scoop" my ideas?

* Date-stamped preregistrations make your claim verifiable
* By the time you’ve preregistered, you are ahead of any possible scooper.
* Embargo your preregistration

## 4. Isn't it easy to cheat?

e.g. Making a “preregistration” after conducting the study; Making multiple preregistrations and only citing the one that “worked.”

* While fairly easy to do, this makes fraud more intentional. Preregistration helps keep you honest to *yourself*

* Preregistration does not assume dishonesty. HARKing and similar practices that preregistration cures typically are unintentional rather than deliberate. Preregistration helps us remember (and show others) what we actually planned.

## 5. Isn't preregistration a ton of extra work?

* Preregistration certainly involves an investment of time "up front", but it can save you time later on when writing your manuscript.
* Basically, once you have written a preregistration, you will have written most of the methods section. 
* Sharing your preregistration and study materials openly will make it easier for others (or yourself) to reproduce your work later on.
