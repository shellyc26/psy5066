# Announcements

#### **Update to Quiz Policy -- 9/29**
Canvas sucks. It doesn't let us program quizzes in a way that works with our current setup. As such, I am changing the policy on quizzes such that you will **_not_** be able to re-take quizzes as many times as you'd like before the due date. Instead, it will be like any other in-person quiz; you show up, take the quiz, and get a score. Quizzes will still be due by 9am on Tuesdays. Answers to the quizzes will appear on Canvas at 9:30am on Tuesdays, so you can always check your answers.

# Overview

This course is the first in a two-course sequence that introduces necessary skills and knowledge for carrying out statistical analyses in the social sciences. The course has an applied focus for psychological research, but theoretical details will be emphasized when they facilitate understanding of key concepts. In other words, we will strike a balance between learning how to do statistics and knowing why we are doing it a particular way. Mastering both will facilitate generalization to new problems and techniques. Topics to be covered this semester include probability theory, measurement scales, theoretical sampling distributions (e.g., binomial, $t$, $F$, $\chi^2$), measures of central tendency and variability, inferences about population means, confidence intervals, the pros and cons of null hypothesis testing, power, and effect sizes.

# Materials

## Textbook

We will primarily be referring to chapters in [_Learning Statistics with R_](https://learningstatisticswithr-bookdown.netlify.com/index.html) by Danielle Navarro. This textbook is available for free online. You may choose to purchase a paper copy if you wish, but it is not required. Additional readings assignments will be posted here. 

## R and RStudio

Students must have the latest version of R, which can be downloaded [here](https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/cran/). It is strongly recommended that students also download the RStudio GUI, available [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). Both softwares are free. 

## Resources for R and RStudio

While we will be covering the use of R and RStudio extensively, one of the key skills required to use R is the ability to find answers on the Internet. The R commmunity (sometimes referred to as the useR community) tends to be friendly and helpful and enjoys solving R-related problems in their spare time. For that reason, many common questions or problems have been posted to spaces online and answered by smart people. Finding and deciphering those answers is the key skill you should seek to hone this year. It's much more important than remembering function names. 

Here are some sites where you can find the answers to many R questions and learn new tricks:
